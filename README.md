# Website Portfolio Revamp
Welcome to the revamped version of my portfolio website! This iteration leverages modern, industry-grade technologies to provide a more dynamic and engaging experience. Below, you'll find an overview of the technologies used, the testing strategies implemented, and additional documentation to help you understand the development process.

## Technologies Used
React: For building the user interface.
Vite: For fast and efficient development.
Vitest: For testing React components.
HTML: For structuring the web content.
TailwindCSS: For styling the application.
JavaScript: For adding interactivity.
GSAP: For creating smooth animations.

## Testing Strategy
Inside the root of this repository, you can find component tests ensuring that:

Functionality: Each component operates correctly.
Expected Values: Components have the correct div elements and character values.
Correct Div Amount: Specific sections have the correct number of divs.

## Code Documentation
The codebase is extensively commented to help you understand:

GSAP Methods: Detailed explanations of the GSAP methods used to create various animations.
HTML and TailwindCSS: Insights into the structure and styling of the components.

## Software Design Document
Included in this repository is a comprehensive Software Design Document. This document outlines the entire process from planning to deployment, including:

Project Goals: The objectives behind the project.
Benefits: Business and personal advantages of the project.
Wireframing: Initial design sketches.
UI & UX Considerations: Design decisions to enhance user experience.
Implementation: Step-by-step development process.
Testing and Deployment: Methods and strategies used to test and deploy the website.

This document serves as a practice in creating and refining future Software Design Documents, offering an in-depth look at the project's development.

Current Status
Both the website and the Software Design Document are works in progress (WIP).
